    <p>
        <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is used to format the layout of a webpage.
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements,
 how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, 
 different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
    </p></br>
    <p>
        The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!

    <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
        <ol>

       <li> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
       <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li></ol></p>
        <p>points to note</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page</li>
        </ul>
